# TicTacToe
Tic tac toe game against different NPC's difficulties and a Player vs Player mode.

This is a simple interface that i made to play tic tac toe with a friend or against an NPC, that can have six different difficulties:
- I let you win: where the NPC litterally choose the moove more advantageous for you;
- Coward: where every NPC's move is random;
- Easy;
- Medium;
- Hard;
- Impossible: where the NPC can not loose, at most the game ends draw.

Do what you want with my game, and if you'll find some issues, bugs or if you have some advices don't hesitate to comment, feedbacks are welcome.
